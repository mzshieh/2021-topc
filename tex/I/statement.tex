The ICPC kingdom has a $n$ city, and there are $m$ roads connecting these cities. 
Each road connected two cities and can travel in both directions. 
There are $a_i$ residents living in the $i$-th city.
The $j$-th road connects the $u_j$ city and $v_j$ city. 
And the economic benefit of the $j$-th road is $\lfloor\sqrt{a_{u_j}+a_{v_j}}\rfloor$.

One day, the enemy comes to the ICPC kingdom and destroys all the roads.
The king of ICPC hired $w$ workers to fix the road.
The $i$-th worker can only fix the roads of index $b_1,b_2,b_3...b_{x_i}$.
And each worker can only fix one road.
Now the king wants to fix the road to make the kingdom normal.
Considering the cost, the king does not want the fix plan to contain the useless roads.
A plan exists for useless roads which means that there is a pair of city $a,b$,
there is more than one simple path from $a$ to $b$.
A simple path is a path $c_1,c_2,c_3,..c_z$ that $c_i \neq c_j$ for each $1\leq i,j \leq z,i\neq j$.
The king asked you to calculate that if we want to fix exactly $k$ road without useless roads, how much is the maximum economic benefit.
You need to calculate for each $k$ between $1$ and $n-1$.
