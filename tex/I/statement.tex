Teams from variaous universities compete in ICPC regional contests for tickets 
to the ICPC World Finals. The number of tickets allocated to every regional
contest may be different. The allocation method in our super region,
Asia Pacific, is based on a parameter called site score.

Site scores will only count teams and universities solving at least one problem,
in the regional contest or its preliminary contest TOPC.
In 2020, the formula for calculating the site score of the Taipei-Hsinchu 
regional contest is much simpler than past years. Let
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item $U_R$ be the number of universities solving at least one problem in 
the regional contest.
\item $T_R$ be the number of teams solving at least one problem in the regional
contest.
\item $U_O$ be the number of universities solving at least one problem in
TOPC. 
\item $T_O$ be the number of teams solving at least one problem in TOPC. 
\end{itemize}
The site score of 2020 Taipei-Hsinchu regional contest will be 
$56U_R+24T_R+14U_O+6T_O$. 
Please write a program to compute the site score of the 2020 Taipei-Hsinchu 
regional contest.
