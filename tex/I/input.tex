The first line contains $n$ and $m$ separated by a white space.
$n$ is the number of cities, and $m$ is the number of roads.
The second line contains $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,a_3...a_n$ separated 
with white spaces indicating the number of the residents in cities $1,2,\dots,n$, respectively.
There are $m$ lines following; each line contains $u_j$ and $v_j$ 
separated with white space. Road $j$ 
connects city $u_j$ and city $v_j$. 
The third line contains a number $w$ indicating the number of workers.
The following $w$ line indicates the roads that can be fixed by the workers.
The $(3+i)$-th line contains several numbers separated by spaces. 
The first number is $x_i$ indicating the number of roads 
that the $i$-th worker can fix.
There are $x_i$ distinct integers 
$b_1,b_2,\dots,b_{x_i}$. 
following in that line.
The $i$-th worker can only fix one of roads $b_1,b_2,\dots,b_{x_i}$.
