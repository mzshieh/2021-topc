You are given an array $[p[1], p[2], ..., p[n]]$ where
all the numbers in the array are distinct.
In addition, the numbers are positive integers between $1$ and $n$.
You can only perform the following operations on the array:
Pick two indices $x$ and $y$ such that $|p[x] - p[y]| = 1$, 
and then swap the values of $p[x]$ and $p[y]$.
We now want to sort this array in ascending order. 
That is, to make $p[i] = i$ for all $i\in\{1,2,\dots,n\}$.
For example, we can sort the array $[p[1]=2,p[2]=3,p[3]=1]$ in two operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Swap $p[1]$ and $p[3]$. The array becomes $[p[1]=1,p[2]=3,p[3]=2]$.
\item Swap $p[2]$ and $p[3]$. The array becomes $[p[1]=1,p[2]=2,p[3]=3]$ which
is sorted in ascending order.
\end{enumerate}

Please write a program to compute the minimum number of operations to
sort a given array.
