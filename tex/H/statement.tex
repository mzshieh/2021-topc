\epigraph{There's no such thing as public opinion.}{\textit{Jordan Ellenberg, American Mathematician}}

In K City lives $n$ residents who want to build a connection network with 
each other. However, some residents want the network wires colored black while 
the others want the wires colored white. The opinion of resident $i$ can be 
quantified as a number $a_i$. If we build a network wire between residents 
$i$ and $j$, the cost of this wire will be $a_i \times a_j$.

The mayor of K City wants to build a network such that:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item There are exactly $n - 1$ wires used.
\item For any two different residents $i$ and $j$, there exists a sequence 
$p_1, \cdots, p_k$ such that $p_1=i$, $p_k=j$ and residents $p_\ell$ and 
$p_{\ell+1}$ share a wire for $1\le \ell < k$.
\end{enumerate}

In other words, the network should be a tree.

You, the renowned mathematician of K City, want to know not only the 
\emph{minimum} 
cost to build the network. In the name of confusion, you also want to know the
\emph{maximum} cost!
