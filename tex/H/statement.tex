You are given a simple undirected graph consisting of $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. 
The nodes are numbered from $1$ to $n$, 
and the edges are numbered from $1$ to $m$.
Node $i$ has a non-negative integer value $V_i$ and the weight $W_{u,v}$ of 
edge $\{u, v\}$ is defined as $\left\|V_u\oplus V_v\right\|$
where $\oplus$ is the exclusive-or operator (equivalent to \verb+^+ in C) and
$\|x\|$ is the number of set bits in the binary representation non-negative
integer $z$.

The node values $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_n$ must satisfy $q$ constraints.
Each of the constraints can be represented as 
a 5-tuple $(t,u,i,v,j)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item if $t = 0$, then $getBit(V_u, i) = getBit(V_v, j)$
\item if $t = 1$, then $getBit(V_u, i) \neq getBit(V_v, j)$
\end{itemize}
where the function $getBit(x, i)$ returns the $(i+1)$-th least significant
bit of $x$. For examples, $getBit(11, 0)$ is $1$ and $getBit(11,2)=0$. 
In the C programming language, $getBit(x, i)$ can be computed by 
\verb+((x >> i) & 1U)+ if $x$ is a 32-bit unsigned integer 
and $i$ is a non-negative integer at most $31$.

Unfortunately, some node values are missing now. 
Your task is to assign new values to them to minimize 
$\sum_{\{u,v\} \in E}W_{u,v}$ without violating any given constraint. 
Please write a program to help yourself to complete this task.
