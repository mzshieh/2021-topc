Output two numbers separated by a blank in a line.
The numbers are the \emph{minimum} cost and the \emph{maximum} cost to build 
the network, respectively. 
Since the absolute value of the costs may be extremely large, you have to 
modulo the answer with $10^9 + 7$.
Please note that the modulo of a number (defined by Donald Knuth) is 
$a\bmod b = a - b \lfloor \frac a b \rfloor$. 
The output number should be non-negetive.
