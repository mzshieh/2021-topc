Suppose you are given an array of $n$ entries
where each entry of the array is either $0$ or $1$.
A subarray $[a[\ell],a[\ell+1],\dots,a[r]]$ of an array
$[a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n]]$ if $1\le \ell \le r\le n$.
An alternating subarray $[a[\ell],a[\ell+1],\dots,a[r]]$ of 
$[a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n]]$
if $a[\ell]\neq a[\ell+1]\neq \cdots \neq a[r]$. I.e., an arbitrary entry
in the subarray is different from its neighbors in the subarray.

In this problem, two types of operations will be applied on the given array.
\begin{itemize}
\item $1~\ell~r$: for every $i\in[\ell,r]$, change $a[i]$ into $1-a[i]$.
\item $2~\ell~r$: report the number of pairs $(x, y)$ such that 
$\ell \leq x \leq y \leq r$ and subarray 
$[a[x],a[x+1],\dots,a[y]]$ is an alternating subarray.
\end{itemize}

Please write a program to maintain the given array.
Your program must report the numbers efficiently.
