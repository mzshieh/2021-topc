Suppose you are given an array of $n$ entries
where each array entry is either $0$ or $1$.
For any pair $(\ell,r)$ such that $1\le \ell \le r\le n$, 
$[a[\ell],a[\ell+1],\dots,a[r]]$ is a subarray of the array
$[a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n]]$.
An alternating subarray $[a[\ell],a[\ell+1],\dots,a[r]]$ of 
$[a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n]]$
if $a[\ell]\neq a[\ell+1]\neq \cdots \neq a[r]$. I.e., every entry
in the subarray is different from its neighbors in the subarray.
Since the definition of alternating subarrays only considers the entries in
the subarrays, $[1,0,1]$ is still an alterating subarray of $[1,1,0,1,1]$.

In this problem, two types of operations will be applied to the given array.
\begin{itemize}
\item $1~\ell~r$: for every $i\in[\ell,r]$, change $a[i]$ into $1-a[i]$.
\item $2~\ell~r$: report the total number of pairs $(x, y)$ such that 
$\ell \leq x \leq y \leq r$ and subarray 
$[a[x],a[x+1],\dots,a[y]]$ is an alternating subarray.
\end{itemize}

Please write a program to maintain the given array.
Your program must report the numbers efficiently.
