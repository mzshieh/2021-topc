The first line consists of two space-separated integers $n$ and $q$.
The $i$-th of the following $q$ lines consists of four space-separated
tokens $\ell_i, r_i, c_i, x_i$. 
For the sake of convenience, \verb+*+ and \verb+/+ are used to represent
the multiplication and the division operators, respectively.
