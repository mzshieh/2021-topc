The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ indicating 
the length of the given array and the number of operations.
The second line contain $n$ space saparated numbers 
$a[1],a[2],\dots,a[n]$
representing 
the given array $[a[1],a[2],\dots,a[n]]$.
Then $q$ lines follows, and the $i$-th of them contains $3$ integers 
$t_{i}, \ell_{i}, r_{i}$ where the $i$-th operation
is $t_i~\ell_i~r_i$.
