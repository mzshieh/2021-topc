JavaScript is one of the most important computer language now.
It is high-level and multi-paradigm.
It supports functional and imperative programming styles.
However, the ICPC World Finals does not offer JavaScript as language tools
for problem solving.

JavaScript is considered as a weakly typed language.
It sometimes implicitly convert values of one type into another type.
For example, the minus operator (\verb|-|) does not have any meaning on strings,
it is defined to operate on numbers. 
When the minus operator is applied on two strings, JavaScript will convert
the operands from strings into numbers and then apply the minus operation.
That is why \verb|"2" + "2" - "2"| is $20$ in JavaScript.
Moreover,
JavaScript convert a string into \verb+NaN+ 
(Not-a-Number) if the string does not represent a number. 
If any operand of a minus operation is \verb+NaN+, 
then the result of the operation must be \verb+NaN+.
For example, \verb|"a" + "2"| is \verb+NaN+.

Given two strings \verb+x+ and \verb+y+, 
please write a program to compute the result 
of \verb|x - y| in JavaScript.
