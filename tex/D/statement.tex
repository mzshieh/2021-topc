Due to COVID-19, social distancing is applied in our daily life to prevent
the spread of the disease. It changes our living styles a lot, especially 
the way of traveling. 
Now, many carriers cancel non-reserved seats and introduce seating rules 
to ensure that the distance between any two passengers is long enough.

On your trip to the 2022 ICPC World Finals, you take a flight.
The airplane provides $n$ reserved seats to $n$ passengers.
The passengers must queue up to board the airplane.
You are the last passenger to board, since you are at the end
of the queue.
Unfortunately, the first boarding passenger is drunk.
The drunk passenger randomly goes to another passenger's seat 
and then sit there.
You may assume the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The drunk passenger never takes their own seat.
\item The probability of any other seat taken by the drunk passenger is uniform.
\end{enumerate}

Luckily, all the other passenger are not drunk. However, they don't want 
to move any passenger from a taken seat. If a passenger's seat has been taken 
by another passenger when boarding, the passenger would randomly take a 
vacant seat with equal probability. 
Otherwise, the passengers just take their own seats.

Please write a program to compute the probability that your seat is taken
by another passenger.
