If there does not exist a point $X$ satisfying David's last will, 
then output \verb+-1+. Otherwise, output two irreducible fractions $x$ 
and $y$ such that $(x,y)$ can be the point $X$ satisfying David's last will. 
You must output an irreducible fraction $t=\frac{n}{d}$ as $n$\verb+/+$d$
with a positive denominator and use exactly one space to separate $x$ and 
$y$.

Note: the numerator and the denominator of any irreducible fraction are integers
and do not have common divisors other than $1$ and $-1$.
