First, output the maximum possible number of cacti on the
first line. Then, output $n$ lines, each line containing a string of 
$m$ characters.
Each of the characters must be one of `\verb+.+', `\verb+*+' and `\verb+C+'.
The $j$-th character of the $i$-th of these lines indicates the status of
the grid cell on the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.
A `\verb+C+' means a cactus should be planted in that particular cell,
and the other cells should be identical to the corresponding position of the 
input.
