There is a rectangle garden in front of Gina's house.
The garden can be seen as an $n$-by-$m$ rectangular grid.
All grid cells are identical squares, and two grid cells are 
considered adjacent if they share an common edge.

Gina loves cacti and wants to plant as many cacti as possible in the garden.
However, there are some constraints on planting cacti.
\begin{itemize}
\item The soil can be too wet in some of the cells and therefore is not 
      suitable for cacti. Gina cannot plant cacti in those cells.
\item Since the soil in each cell is not fertile enough to grow two or more 
      cacti, Gina may plant at most one cactus in a cell.
\item At most one cactus can be planted in any pair of adjacent cells. 
      Otherwise, the cacti in those cells may be harmed by their neighbor's
      thorns.
\end{itemize}

Please write a program to help Gina calculate the maximum possible number of 
cacti can be planted, and also a way of plantings that meet the listed 
constraints.
