The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$
meaning the garden is an $n$-by-$m$ grid.
Then, each of the following $n$ lines contains a string of $m$ characters.
These characters are either `\verb+.+' or `\verb+*+'.
The $j$-th character of the $i$-th of these lines indicates whether
the soil in the grid cell on the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is 
suitable for planting a cactus. 
`\verb+.+' means it is suitable, and `\verb+*+' means it is not suitable.
