You must output a requested trajectory in the following format:

The trajectory is represented by $m+1$ lines where $m$ is the number of
steps of the trajectory.
The $i$-th line contains two integers $r_i$ and $c_i$ separated by 
exactly one space.
The trajectory starts at the cell $(r_1,c_1)$, and
Pac-Man will be in cell $(r_i,c_i)$ after moving $i-1$ steps 
along the trajectory for $1<i\le m+1$.
