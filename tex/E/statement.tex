Eric developed a new algorithm to mine a cryptocurrency called 
Eatcoin. 
Since Eric's algorithm is an evalutionary algorithm,
its performance keeps improving. 
On the $d$-th day of the execution of Eric's algorithm, 
it consumes $p$ Eatcoins and then
produces $q\times d^5$ Eatcoins where $p$ and $q$
are positive constants.

Eric wants to become a ``duotrigintillionaire''. 
A duotrigintillionaire is a person who has at least $10^{99}$ Eatcoins. 
Eric plans to exploit his algorithm to achieve his goal.
Eric's algorithm can soon produce a huge amount of Eatcoins if
he has enough Eatcoins.
However, his algorithm cannot continue if he does not have
$p$ Eatcoins when needed.

Eric gives the values of $p$ and $q$ to you. Please write a program
to help Eric to compute two numbers $x$ and $y$ defined as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item $x$ is the minimum number of Eatcoins required to execute Eric's 
algorithm to make him a duotrigintillionaire.
\item $y$ is the minimum number of days required to make Eric a 
duotrigintillionaire if Eric has exactly $x$ Eatcoins before executing his algorithm.
\end{itemize}
