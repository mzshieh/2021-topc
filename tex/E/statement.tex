A binary string is a string consisting of only $0$'s and $1$'s. 
Elsa, Eric's boss, gave him a binary string $s$ of length 20 and
asked him to modify $s$ into another binary string $t$ within $D$ days.

Eric really hates this task and therefore never modifies more than one 
character in a day.
However, being forced to show Elsa the daily progress,
Eric must modify some characters of the string every day.
That means, the only possible way for Eric is to modify exact one character 
in each day before he finishes the task.

It is obviously cheating to have a character changed to something other than 
$0$ and $1$.
Moreover, Eric will be caught cheating if the string is modified into the same
binary string twice since Elsa has a good memory.
That is, before the string is modified into $t$, all modifications result in
unique strings.
Note that Eric cannot modify the string into $s$ which is the string given by 
Elsa, either.

Eric wants to spend as much time as possible. 
He is wondering if he can spend exact $D$ days to have the string $s$
modified into $t$.
Please write a program to help Eric.
