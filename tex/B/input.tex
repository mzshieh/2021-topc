The first line contains four space-separated integers $p_1,q_1,p_2$ and $q_2$.
Bob has colored the sectors $[p_1,q_1]$ and $[p_2,q_2]$.
The second line contains an integer $q$ indicating that Ben has made
$q$ proposals. 
Each of the remaining $q$ lines contains an integer $x$ indicating 
the positions to be folded by Ben.
Note that the $q$ proposals are independent to each other. 
There is only one folding point in one proposal.
